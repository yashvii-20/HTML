       <h2> Posted by untravel | | Himachal Pradesh, India, Nature, Relax</h2>
       <p>Shimla offers much more than charming colonial buildings against a backdrop of the magnificent snow-capped Himalayas. Much more than the dozens of Bollywood songs set on Mall Road or its oldest boarding schools. The upper reaches around the Shimla region offer skating on natural ice as well as host the MTB Himalaya (South East Asia’s biggest mountain biking race). Shimla also boasts ownership of the 16th century “Arya Astha Sahasrikas Prajna Paramita” Tibetan script (at the quaint Maria Brothers antique booksellers) and the Jakhu Temple Shrine with Lord Hanuman’s footprints.

Originally part of the Kingdom of Nepal (before it was declared the British Summer Capital of India), pleasant summers and snow-covered winters make Shimla a favorite weekend getaway with tourists all year-round. Expect a tattoo artist around every corner, but expect no food after midnight. Legendary ghost stories (Chudail Baudi, for single men whose cars slow down for the lady in the white sari) and fantastic cultural heritage make this visit all the more memorable. un[travel] your way up that UNESCO heritage railway route to Shimla for sights and sounds like never before.</p>
<h2>Places to visit in Shimla</h2>
<h3>1.Heritage Walk through Shimla</h3><br>Heritage Walk through ShimlaShimla has a lot of stories to tell, some legends, and more heritage, but all equally exciting. Begins at the appropriately named ‘Scandal Point’ where legend has it that the Maharajah of Patiala was exiled from Shimla after a fierce argument with the Viceroy (some stories say he eloped with the Viceroy’s daughter) and was eventually exiled from Shimla –giving this spot its name in 1892. Send yourself a postcard from the timber-structured ‘wild west Swiss’-styled 133-year-old <em>Shimla General Post Office as a souvenir.</em></br><br><br><h3>2. Kufri and Chail</h3>
</br>Lush green hills mark summer in Kufri– a stark contrast to the fantastic snow slopes that make tobogganing ‘the’ thing to do at the end of the year. If you’re visiting in January, try your hand at the <em>‘National Snow Statue Competition’</em> here in Kufri. A short walk around would take you past colonial-Esque statues at Chini Bungalow to the Himalayan nature park.<br><br><h3>3. Kipling’s home and Viceregal Lodge</h3></br>What makes Shimla more alluring is its glorious past, the days when it was the summer capital during the British Raj. Beneath the Kali Bari temple, at the North Bank, lays an ordinary house where there once lived an extraordinary writer, Rudyard Kipling. This Nobel laureate spent most of his summer vacations here where memories of Jungle Book still linger on. Move on to the Viceregal Lodge. This was originally built as a home and summer residence of subsequent viceroys and governors-general of India. Leave history behind, for a peaceful walk through dense forests for a quiet moment of solitude with a quaint picnic basket for the company.<br><h3>4. Toy Train Ride</h3>103 tunnels, 864 bridges, 919 curves, and a ride of a lifetime: Welcome aboard the Shimla-Kalka <em>‘toy train’</em>. This UNESCO heritage train chugs slowly up the mountains, seemingly playing an interesting game of hiding and seek with tunnels. Gradual ascents on winding tracks, flanked by age-old trees on either side, seem straight out of a storybook. Over a century old, the ‘toy train’ still chugs into the hearts of the hundreds who travel in it every day. Made more memorable with numerous Bollywood songs, there’s nothing like a ride up to Shimla with the tune of ‘gaadi bula rahi hai, seeti baja rahi hai’ probably playing on in your head.
<br><h4>Things to carry</h4>Pack as light as possible given the amount of road travel involved here.
<br>i.Cotton clothing for summer and a light jacket would work for when evenings get cooler. If you’re un[travel]ling in winter, warmer clothes complete with thick socks and warmer jackets. Carry your windcheater and umbrella if you’re here in the monsoons as well.
<br>ii. Sturdy walking shoes, mandatory if you’re hiking, make sense given the amount of walking involved here.
<br>iii. Sunscreen, especially if you’re going up to the higher reaches. Usual prescription medications.
<br>iv.Mobile and tablet electronic chargers.
